# Foundry Plugin Handoff

Read this at the start of every session. Update it before context compaction or at natural milestones.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-26

## What This Repo Is

The **public plugin** for Foundry — an adversarial red/green development workflow where isolated agent teams develop features from a shared NLSpec without seeing each other's work.

Installable via:
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add github:Lightless-Labs/foundry
claude plugin install foundry
```

This repo is the **skills + agents + examples** side. The Rust engine (state machine, concurrent dispatch, write lock coordination) lives in the private monorepo at `lightless-labs/lightless-labs/foundry/`.

## Current State

### Validation: 224/224 checks passing + arbiter evals + replay/Pi/Codex/module self-tests + Pi adversarial smoke

`tests/validate-agents.sh` covers structural (YAML frontmatter, required sections, model: inherit, tools), attribution (12 adopted agents), language-specific coverage, adversarial process coverage including the scoped arbiter, and territory boundaries.

Additional validators:
- `tests/validate-barrier-envelopes.sh` — PromptEnvelope v1 replay/audit checks, including green PASS/FAIL-only gates and arbiter single-test scope gates.
- `tests/behavioral-smoke.sh` — replay-level run checks over PromptEnvelope artifacts plus `behavioral-smoke.toon` summaries (example pass rates, model lanes, divergence restart counts).
- `tests/arbiter-routing-evals.sh` — deterministic Gherkin-driven eval runner for mocked arbiter routes (`TEST_WRONG`, `IMPLEMENTATION_WRONG`, `SPEC_INCOMPLETE`, `INCONCLUSIVE`) and downstream barrier-preserving follow-up.
- `tests/validate-behavioral-smoke-contract.sh` — ensures `foundry-adversarial` requires real runs to emit/validate `behavioral-smoke.toon`.
- `tests/validate-pi-extension.sh` — ensures the Pi package exposes the `foundry_team` child-dispatch extension and uses the PromptEnvelope contract, including runtime arbiter scope rejection.
- `tests/validate-codex-plugin.sh` — ensures the Codex CLI plugin manifest exposes the root Agent Skills adapters, canonical-source links, command wrappers, agent-card blocker notes, and barrier-language anchors.
- `tests/validate-adversarial-modules.sh` — ensures extracted adversarial playbooks preserve divergence routing, scoped arbiter routing/evals, `spec_update_and_restart`, provider troubleshooting, and critical grep anchors.
- `tests/pi-live-dispatch-smoke.sh` — slow/manual live lane that performs real Pi model calls, runs Sudoku `30/30`, dispatches red/green child Pi processes through `foundry_team`, writes `behavioral-smoke.toon`, and validates the resulting run directory.
- `runs/pi-autonomous-sudoku-smoke/` — smoke-scoped autonomous `/skill:foundry-adversarial` Pi run artifacts (red-team, green-team, barrier-integrity-auditor PromptEnvelopes + `behavioral-smoke.toon`).

Last local validation (2026-05-26): `tests/validate-agents.sh` passed 224/224 with the new arbiter agent; `tests/arbiter-routing-evals.sh` passed 4/4 mocked route evals; `tests/validate-adversarial-modules.sh` passed 54/54; `tests/validate-codex-plugin.sh` passed 44/44; `tests/validate-pi-extension.sh` passed 43/43; `tests/validate-behavioral-smoke-contract.sh` passed 7/7; `tests/validate-barrier-envelopes.sh` self-tests passed including outcome-label withheld-sample regression plus good/bad arbiter scope cases; `tests/validate-barrier-envelopes.sh runs/pi-autonomous-sudoku-smoke/dispatch` passed; `tests/behavioral-smoke.sh runs/pi-autonomous-sudoku-smoke` passed; `tests/validate-barrier-envelopes.sh runs/pi-from-scratch-roman-numeral/dispatch` passed; `tests/behavioral-smoke.sh runs/pi-from-scratch-roman-numeral` passed. Last slow live lane remains 2026-05-22: `tests/pi-live-dispatch-smoke.sh --keep` passed with a real `foundry_team` Pi tool call; `/skill:foundry-adversarial` under Pi produced `runs/pi-autonomous-sudoku-smoke/` with Sudoku `30/30` and provider-qualified `openai-codex/gpt-5.5` model lanes. New from-scratch live Pi run (2026-05-24) produced `runs/pi-from-scratch-roman-numeral/` with fresh red tests, fresh green implementation, and Roman numeral `8/8`.

### 5 Skills (composable pipeline)

| Skill | Triggers | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `foundry:research` | "research this", "investigate" | Research context doc |
| `foundry:brainstorm` | "brainstorm", "spec this out" | Spec document (via user dialogue) |
| `foundry:nlspec` | "nlspec", "derive nlspec" | NLSpec (Why/What/How/Done) |
| `foundry:adversarial` | "adversarial", "red green" | Implementation + tests with information barrier |
| `foundry:forge` | "forge", "full pipeline" | All 4 above in sequence, gated |

Each skill can be invoked independently. Forge composes them with gates between phases and skip logic (existing artifacts skip their phase).

### Pi and Codex package support

Root `package.json` makes this repo installable as a Pi package (`pi-package` keyword) and exposes `extensions/pi-foundry-team/` plus Agent Skills-compatible adapters under `skills/`.

`foundry_team` is the Pi-side team/subagent primitive. Pi intentionally has no built-in subagents; this extension follows Pi's officially shipped `examples/extensions/subagent/` pattern by spawning child `pi --mode json -p --no-session` processes. It dispatches from PromptEnvelope paths, validates withheld samples first, disables child sessions/extensions/skills/prompt-templates/context-files by default, reports provider-qualified actual model lane IDs when Pi exposes provider+model, and reuses canonical agent prompts from `plugins/foundry/agents/**/*.md`.

Agent Skills adapters expose `/skill:foundry-research`, `/skill:foundry-brainstorm`, `/skill:foundry-nlspec`, `/skill:foundry-adversarial`, and `/skill:foundry-forge`. They are thin wrappers that instruct Pi/Codex to read the canonical Claude plugin skill files under `plugins/foundry/skills/**/SKILL.md`; do not fork workflow prompts into the adapters.

Codex CLI packaging lives at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and exposes `"skills": "./skills/"`, `commands/foundry-{adversarial,forge}.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, and `assets/foundry-codex.svg`. Local smoke-load with a temporary HOME succeeded via `codex plugin marketplace add "$PWD"` on 2026-05-24. Current Codex blocker: examples expose `agents/openai.yaml` as an agent card, but the installed CLI does not document a Claude-style dispatchable subagent API; canonical Foundry reviewers remain under `plugins/foundry/agents/**/*.md` until a PromptEnvelope-safe Codex dispatch primitive is confirmed.

### 25 Agents

**Adversarial process (7):** arbiter-agent, barrier-integrity-auditor, divergence-evaluator, green-team-reviewer, red-team-test-reviewer, nlspec-fidelity-reviewer, spec-completeness-reviewer

**Language-specific (6):** rust, swift, typescript, bazel, cucumber, uniffi-bridge

**Adopted from Compound Engineering (12, with attribution):** correctness, testing, reliability, maintainability, security-sentinel, api-contract, architecture-strategist, code-simplicity, data-migrations, learnings-researcher, feasibility, adversarial-document

All agents use `model: inherit`.

### 3 Worked Examples (progressive difficulty)

| Example | Result | Key Lesson |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Sudoku solver | 30/30 | Clean constraint problem, no convention ambiguity |
| Rubik's cube | 31/46 | Convention mismatch deadlock — spec lacked golden vectors. Intentional case study. |
| Chess engine | 44/44 | Golden test vectors (perft numbers) prevent convention mismatch; NLSpec derivation bug caught |

Each example preserves all artifacts: research doc, spec, NLSpec, red team tests, green team implementation, README walkthrough.

### Todos

| File | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `todos/spec-divergence-feedback-loop.md` | P2 | **MERGED** — `divergence-evaluator` agent + adversarial skill Phase 1b/2b/restart extensions. 93/93 red team tests pass. Merged via PR #1 on 2026-04-08. |
| `todos/repo-identity-public-plugin.md` | High | **COMPLETED 2026-05-01** — root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` now identify this as the public plugin/skills/agents repo and call out the private Rust engine split |

## Information Barrier (core invariant)

| Entity | Sees | Never sees |
|--------|------|------------|
| Red team | NLSpec (full), spec | Implementation code |
| Green team | NLSpec How section only, test outcome labels (PASS/FAIL) | Test code, assertions, error messages, NLSpec Done section |
| Arbiter agent | Full spec/NLSpec, one disputed test artifact, relevant implementation snippet, one runner result | Full red suite, full implementation, broad red/green conversation history |
| Orchestrator | Everything | — |
| Test runner | Both (execution only, no judgment) | — |

Green receives ONLY `test_name: PASS/FAIL` — no assertions, no expected values, no stack traces, no .feature file content.

## Agent Dispatch Map

| Skill Phase | Agents Dispatched |
|-------------|-------------------|
| brainstorm (review) | spec-completeness-reviewer; +adversarial-document/feasibility (conditional, 10+ reqs) |
| nlspec (review) | nlspec-fidelity-reviewer; +adversarial-document/spec-completeness (conditional, 10+ DoD) |
| adversarial (setup) | learnings-researcher |
| adversarial (red review) | red-team-test-reviewer, cucumber-reviewer, barrier-integrity-auditor |
| adversarial (arbitration, conditional) | arbiter-agent for one disputed test at a time after normal divergence routing or suspicious-pass evidence |
| adversarial (final review) | green-team-reviewer, red-team-test-reviewer, barrier-integrity-auditor, language-specific (auto), correctness, testing, reliability |

## Key Learnings

- **Golden test vectors are non-negotiable** — NLSpecs for state transformations MUST include concrete reference outputs. Without them, red and green diverge at the convention level (Rubik's failure vs Chess success).
- **Orchestrator must be stateless** — reading both sides and fixing code directly breaks provenance, even if all tests pass. Route fixes through the proper team.
- **Red team test data quality** — wrong test data under the information barrier amplifies damage. Green team can't see the test code to identify bad inputs. Verify against authoritative sources.
- **NLSpec derivation errors** — agents mix inputs from one source with outputs from another (e.g., FEN from position A with perft numbers from position B). Cross-check vectors against research docs.
- **Multi-provider strengthens the adversarial property** — different model families have different blind spots. Red on Gemini, green on Codex, orchestrator on Claude. Infrastructure ready, not yet systematically exercised.
- **Research as reflex** — fire research after every user reply during brainstorm when unknowns surface, not as a one-shot phase before brainstorm.
- **Deferred commit pattern** — in a two-commit before/after sequence, the pre-operation commit must come AFTER the operation succeeds, not before. If the operation can fail, committing before ties your hands. Also guard with `git diff --staged --quiet` to handle nothing-staged edge case. See `docs/solutions/workflow-issues/deferred-commit-pattern-20260408.md`.
- **Grep anchors in skill docs** — test scripts that grep for "Phase 2b" near "VALUABLE" require both terms on the same line. Context labels in routing sections (e.g., "Phase 2b \`VALUABLE\`") serve double duty as documentation and grep anchors. Remove them and tests silently regress.
- **Ephemeral evaluator output shape** — evaluators that follow the reviewer schema return `findings[0].outcome`, not a top-level `outcome` field. Routing logic and all prose references must use `findings[0].*`, not `DivergenceJudgment.*`. The two names diverge unless explicitly kept in sync.
- **Pi has no native subagents** — do not write Pi instructions that assume Claude-style `Agent(...)`, teams, or swarms. Roll the primitive as an extension. The endorsed pattern is Pi's own `examples/extensions/subagent/`: spawn child `pi --mode json -p --no-session` processes, bound concurrency, stream/capture JSON events, and keep child contexts explicit.
- **PromptEnvelope is the cross-harness dispatch boundary** — Claude can pass `envelope.prompt` to `Agent(...)`; Pi must call `foundry_team` with `envelopePath`. Never paste hidden context into normal Pi messages to simulate a subagent.
- **Green test-result blocks need a hard section terminator** — `validate-barrier-envelopes.sh` treats lines after `Test results:` as outcome labels until the next `#`/`##` header. Put follow-up instructions under `## Task`; otherwise ordinary prose such as `Reply exactly: GREEN_OK` is correctly rejected as a non-PASS/FAIL result leak.
- **Codex plugin support is packaging, not subagents (yet)** — local Codex examples use `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, optional `commands/`, and `agents/openai.yaml` agent cards. The installed CLI can smoke-load this repo as a local marketplace, but does not document a Claude-style dispatchable subagent API. Keep canonical reviewer prompts under `plugins/foundry/agents/**/*.md` until a PromptEnvelope-safe Codex dispatch primitive exists.
- **Module extraction needs validators for old grep anchors** — moving bulky adversarial instructions into playbooks is safe only if tests preserve anchor strings such as `findings[0].outcome`, Phase 2b `VALUABLE`, `spec_update_and_restart`, and PASS/FAIL-only barrier language.
- **From-scratch Pi works but needs resumable/longer live orchestration** — Roman numeral run generated fresh red tests and green code and reached Phase 3, but the outer 900s shell timeout interrupted reviewer fan-out. Continue via PromptEnvelope/foundry_team worked, but future live lanes should use longer timeouts, sessions, or phase-level resumability.
- **Withheld samples must exclude allowed outcome labels** — a continuation envelope used a test name as a withheld red-test sample while the same name was allowed in `Test results:`. `foundry_team` correctly rejected it. This is now mechanically checked in `tests/validate-barrier-envelopes.sh` and `extensions/pi-foundry-team/index.ts`; samples should come from assertion/body/raw-output snippets, not PASS/FAIL label names.
- **Scoped arbitration is a controlled breach, not a new normal** — `arbiter-agent` may see one disputed test, the relevant implementation snippet, full spec/NLSpec, and one runner result. Its raw context/output goes only to the orchestrator; red/green follow-up must be redacted back to normal barrier rules. `tests/validate-barrier-envelopes.sh` and `foundry_team` now require `ArbiterInput`, exactly one `disputed_test`/`test_artifact`, scoped visible-context categories, withheld samples, and `single_test_scope` redaction metadata.
- **Workflow evals can be Gherkin-authored mocks** — `tests/fixtures/arbiter-routing-evals.feature` demonstrates reusable BDD-style eval cases for agent/process behavior. The runner mocks arbiter JSON outputs, validates generated PromptEnvelopes, and checks downstream barrier-preserving routes without live model calls.

## What's Next

Ilia feedback (2026-04-17, `docs/solutions/workflow-issues/ilia-feedback-foundry-plugin-20260417.md`) raised four structural items. Repo identity is complete, the private dispatch runtime mirrors the public `PromptEnvelope` v1 contract, and a replay-level behavioral smoke harness now exists. The remaining suggested order is:

1. **Codex dispatch follow-up** (`todos/pi-codex-plugin-support.md`) — packaging is done; revisit only when Codex documents a PromptEnvelope-safe dispatchable subagent/team primitive.
2. **Continue modularization only from evidence** (`todos/modularize-heaviest-skills.md`) — first slice, arbiter routing/scope validation/evals, and Roman-run hardening are done; profile future real runs before extracting more modules.

Also still open from before:

3. **Multi-provider delegation** — systematically exercise red-on-Gemini, green-on-Codex across examples
4. **Adversarial UI** — brainstorm at `docs/brainstorms/2026-04-04-adversarial-ui-design-system.md`; three-level testing via design systems
5. **Rubik's cube fix** — add golden vectors from Kociemba's Python reference (31/46 -> ~44/46)
6. **Phase 2 trigger strategy** — re-assess N=3 vs pattern-based (`todos/phase2-trigger-strategy.md`)
7. **Exercise spec-divergence/arbiter loops live** — deterministic arbiter evals now exist; next step is a real end-to-end example that triggers divergence evaluator and scoped arbiter behavior in practice
